						<div class="panel-heading">What is Explore Classical?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">Explore Classical was born out of the idea that Classical Music should be a genre to be accepted in mainstream media once again.
						It is in many places seen as the educated mans genre, and thereby excludeing typically the younger generations, which is a cultural loss.
						This is described more on the <a href="About.html">about</a> page.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="panel panel-danger">
						<div class="panel-heading">Why can't I play the music?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">The music on this site uses Spotify. In order to have a smooth experience, you need <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> installed and opened.</div>
					</div>
				</li>				
				<li>
					<div class="panel panel-primary">
						<div class="panel-heading">Why do I need spotify?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">Spotify hosts a large number of classical pieces for free, meaning we can have good quality music with minimal disturbances.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="panel panel-success">
						<div class="panel-heading">Do I need to create a user both here and on Spotify?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">Fortunately, you need not create a user here for this site to use it's features in its current state.
						You do however need a spotify account for the most smooth experience, but this should not be a problem, as Spotify uses Facebook Login. </div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="panel panel-info">
						<div class="panel-heading">Are you making money off of this site?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">Currently this site is not monetised in any way. 
						The few adds that might occur during the music is from Spotify itself, and can be avoided by getting a subscription there, though it is not neccesary at all.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-heading">Who are you?</div>
						<div class="panel-body">The organisation behind Explore Classical is based out of Copenhagen, and has the sole focus of bringing classical music to the people.</div>
