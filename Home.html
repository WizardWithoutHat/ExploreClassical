				<p> This website offers you access into the world of one of the greatest genres of music in the history of man, Classical Music. 
					Classical music has been around for centuries, and has usually been seen as the educated mans music, which has led to it being less prevalent in the modern scene.
					This website aims to correct this by bringing you the wonders of the classical genre, to prove that this has more to offer to the modern society than you'd think. </p>
					
				<p> To the right you can have a taste of what we will show you.
